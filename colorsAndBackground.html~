<h1>Colors and Background</h1>
<div id="intro" class="instructions">
<p>So far, we've been setting colors using the named CSS colors. You can also choose any color you like using numeric codes. You may have seen these codes in the source of other websites, or in other online tools, they look like this #FF0478. These six digit codes use leffers as well as numbers, because they employ what is called hexadecimal notation, in which numbers from 0-15 are represented by the ten numbers we're familiar with, plus letters A(10) through F(15). </p>
<p>Each six digit code can be divided into three two-digit sections. The first two digits represent how much red is present in the color, the second two set the green, and the last two the blue. You can make any color you like by setting values for each color, from very high (FF) to very low (00). For example #000000 is black and #FFFFFF is white. To more clearly see how this works, set the background color of each of the divs below to the color code displayed in the div.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercise1" class="exercise">
	<div id="test1">
	#FF0000
	</div>
	<div id="test2">
	#00FF00
	</div>
	<div id="test3">
	#0000FF
	</div>
        <div id="test4">
	#9900CC
	</div>
</div>
<div id="instructions2" class="instructions">
<p>We can mix colors manually using the six-digit codes, but we rarely do (occasionally this is a useful method to tweak a color value a little bit). Instead, we usually use various tools to generate colors and then apply the color codes these tools generate to our CSS. One easy to use tool is <a href="http://coolors.co">coolors</a>. Click the link to head over to coolors and try it out. Play with it and see what it does. When you generate a color scheme you like, apply it to the swatch divs below by setting background-color for #swatch1 through #swatch5 in the style section to the color values generated by coolors.</p>

<div id="exercise2" class="exercise">
	<div id="swatch1">
	Swatch1
	</div>
	<div id="swatch2">
	Swatch2
	</div>
	<div id="swatch3">
	Swatch3
	</div>
	<div id="swatch4">
	Swatch4
	</div>
	<div id="swatch5">
	Swatch5
	</div>
</div>
<div id="instructions3" class="instructions">
<p>We can add background images to elements with the background-image rule. For example, to add the image "star.png" located in this directory, as a background image for the div exercise3 below, add: background-image: url("star.png") to the #exercise3 section in the style element above.</p>
<p>You can manipulate how the background image appears with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-repeat">background-repeat</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position">background-position</a> rules. Read up on these by clicking on the links and experiment.</p>

<p>"Did you groan?" asked Dorothy.</p>

	<p>"Yes," answered the tin man, "I did.  I've been groaning for more than a year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me."</p>

	<p>"What can I do for you?" she inquired softly, for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke.</p>

	<p>"Get an oil-can and oil my joints," he answered.  "They are rusted so badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon be all right again.  You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage."</p>

	<p>Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then she returned and asked anxiously, "Where are your joints?"</p>

	<p>"Oil my neck, first," replied the Tin Woodman.  So she oiled it, and as it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the man could turn it himself.</p>
